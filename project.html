        <p class="text-left">Yes, you read that right. This is a case study about improving this case study. I know, it’s a bit of a mind-bender. I like to think of it this way:</p>
        <p class="text-left indentText"><mark class="coralText">I had a UX portfolio that wasn’t working; I wasn’t getting as many call-backs as I’d like during my job search.</mark> I suspected that it had a lot to do with my portfolio website, and specifically the case studies. Truthfully, I should have paid more attention to the case studies during my first two rounds of design. The primary reason to create a portfolio website is to provide a medium to showcase your best work. While I had conducted three user interviews with UX hiring managers back in October, I felt that I had not adequately reflected my findings in my design, and was not catering to their needs. If I wanted a better response to my job applications, I needed to impress and delight UX hiring managers and recruiters with my case studies.</p>
        <p class="text-left"><mark class="coralText">So, I decided to “hire” myself as a UX Designer to diagnose and fix the problem(s).</mark> After all, that is my job. Keep reading to find out how I approached the problem. </p>

        <p class="text-left">In considering where I had gone wrong in my past designs, <mark class="coralText">I could tell right away that I had lost sight of my target users</mark>. I had all the data I needed from interviews I conducted in October 2017, but I had overlooked a lot of it. So, to get myself back on track and refocus on the user, <mark class="coralText">I started this project by creating personas for my two main target users.</mark></p>

        <p class="text-left"><mark class="coralText">To create the personas, I used information that I had collected during user interviews</mark> with three UX hiring managers. I also conducted online research to get a better idea of what a recruiter might be looking for in a UX case study.</p>
        <p class="text-left">Of these two personas, I wanted to concentrate on the UX Hiring Manager more thoroughly. It would be a hiring manager who would be more invested in reading my case studies, and a hiring manager to whom I would likely present my case studies (if I got an interview). With that in mind, <mark class="coralText">I created an empathy map that would enhance my understanding of the UX Hiring Manager as a target user.</mark></p>

Both my time and money was limited, so I had to find family and friends to participate in this round of testing.

It took testers an average of over one minute to find evidence of key words and concepts that a hiring manager or recruiter would surely be looking for, such as “prototype”, my role in the project, whether I worked with a team, and whether I learned anything from the project. These statistics certainly demonstrated that I had neglected to design around my target users.</p>
        <p class="text-left"><mark class="coralText">While my user tests uncovered several major issues, they did not reveal why the issues existed.</mark> To find out, for example, why users were uninterested in the page, I needed to do some interviews.

        <p class="text-left indentText">
            “After reading the first paragraph, <mark class="coralText">I don’t want to keep reading.</mark> I can see that the page is really long, but I have no idea what’s coming next. <mark class="coralText">It just feels overwhelming.</mark>”
