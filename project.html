            <p class="text-left indentText"><span class="highlightedText">I had a UX portfolio that wasn’t working; I wasn’t getting as many call-backs as I’d like during my job search.</span> I suspected that it had a lot to do with my portfolio website, and specifically the case studies. Truthfully, I should have paid more attention to the case studies during my first two rounds of design. The primary reason to create a portfolio website is to provide a medium to showcase your best work. While I had conducted three user interviews with UX hiring managers back in October, I felt that I had not adequately reflected my findings in my design, and was not catering to their needs. If I wanted a better response to my job applications, I needed to impress and delight UX hiring managers and recruiters with my case studies.</p>
            <p class="text-left"><span class="highlightedText">So, I decided to “hire” myself as a UX Designer to diagnose and fix the problem(s).</span> After all, that is my job. Keep reading to find out how I approached the problem. </p>

I had all the data I needed from interviews I conducted in October 2017, but I had overlooked a lot of it.

            <p class="text-left"><span class="highlightedText">To create the personas, I used information that I had collected during user interviews</span> with three UX hiring managers.

It would be a hiring manager who would be more invested in reading my case studies, and a hiring manager to whom I would likely present my case studies (if I got an interview). With that in mind, <span class="highlightedText">I created an empathy map that would enhance my understanding of the UX Hiring Manager as a target user.</span></p>
