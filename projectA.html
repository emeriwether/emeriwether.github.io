            <h5>The QuickSight Quest: Design Discovery to Sign-Off In Two Weeks</h5>
            <p class="text-left">In our initial discovery and design sprint, my knack for asking incisive questions and bringing customer ideas to life steered the project, ensuring smooth and successful progress. Here are some highlights:</p>
            <ol class="indentText">
                <li style="display: block;"> <!-- Overrides the display: flex; from site.css -->
                  <span style="font-weight: bold; display: inline;">Kicking Off Design Discovery</span> To start, I tapped into our sales team's knowledge about DataGuardian's goals and challenges to shape some initial design sketches.
                </li>
                <li style="display: block;"> <!-- Overrides the display: flex; from site.css -->
                  <span style="font-weight: bold; display: inline;">Creative Solution Crafting</span> During our initial discovery call, I realized my sketches weren't compelling or "cool" enough for DataGuardian‚Äôs needs. So, I revisited the designs, drawing inspiration from QuickSight's DemoCentral and discussing available data with our developers to brainstorm new graph concepts.
                </li>
                <li style="display: block;"> <!-- Overrides the display: flex; from site.css -->
                  <span style="font-weight: bold; display: inline;">Initiative in User Research</span> Despite typical project constraints like limited time and resources for user research, I identified a chance for valuable user insight right within our team. Given our own sales team perfectly matched the target user profile, I initiated some quick, direct user research.
                </li>
                <li style="display: block;"> <!-- Overrides the display: flex; from site.css -->
                  <span style="font-weight: bold; display: inline;">Achieving Final Sign-off</span> Through several more cycles of discovery, sketch iterations, and review with both the customer and developers, I honed in on graph choices that narrated a well-rounded and compelling story, enriched by insights from my user research.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p class="text-left">The sitemap outline then went through several rounds of iteration as I received feedback from the COO. She pointed out where content was missing or inaccurate, and expressed preferences over labels and groupings. </p>   
            <p class="text-left">For example, the client preferred using the term ‚ÄúLearn‚Äù over ‚ÄúEducation‚Äù for the navigation link to the area of the website that provided users with information about cannabis and its benefits. I implemented the request, but asked permission to do tree testing, to check whether the term would make sense to users. I am currently running simple user tests on Optimal Workshop‚Äôs Treejack service, to find out whether users will know what to expect in the ‚ÄúLearn Section‚Äù. </p>            
            <p class="text-left">Finally, after the client, developer, and I were happy with the way the site was organized, I sketched a visual representation of the page hierarchy. This also helped the client and I make a checklist of all of the content that we would need to create for each page.</p>

            <h5>Home Page Mockup</h5>
            <p class="text-left">As I was working on the sitemap, Jeremy began a rough mockup of how the home page would be laid out. We quickly realized that the copy on the current homepage would not work, and so I was tasked with helping the client re-write it to make their message clearer, and to better connect with users. </p>
            <p class="text-left">Using Jeremy‚Äôs mockup, I drafted out appropriate content, and then sent it to Natalie for review. She and I collaborated to modify the text, and we ended with a version that we were both very happy with. </p>

            <p class="text-left">Next, Jeremy created a more detailed mockup, and Natalie and I both provided feedback. I felt that the design had too many areas of dense text, without any graphics to break it up, and Natalie agreed. I suggested that we change and highlight the service icons, incorporate a photo as a background for one of the sections, and add in pictures of the doctors who provided testimonials. I then created a new version of the mockup to illustrate my ideas, and both Natalie and Jeremy were happy with the results. </p>

            <p class="text-left">Because I had one foot in the content strategy and creation, and one foot in the design and development of the website, I was in an excellent position to plan out the remaining pages. I quickly sketched each page, using a pen and paper, and making sure that the styling was in line to the home page styling that Jeremy created. My main priorities were to structure the pages following good usability principles, and to ensure that all of the content was represented. After iterating on the pages with the developer and client, I created wireframes of the pages using Sketch.</p>

            <h5>Further Content Creation</h5>
            <p class="text-left">Natalie was so pleased with the content that I had created for the home page that she asked me to help her with the content for the rest of the site. In reviewing and helping to create this content, I was able to ensure that the website copy remained consistent and was written in a conversational tone.</p>
            <p class="text-left">As Natalie received resources from her team to add to the website, such as doctor articles and testimonials and other educational content, I edited each piece. I focused on removing any jargon and any words or phrases that were corporate-sounding, verbose, or pedantic. I ensured that each sentence made sense and was concise, and had no grammatical errors. Above all, I checked that every piece of the copy had purpose and significantly contributed to the overall message. </p>

            <h5>Finding Time for User-Centered Techniques</h5>
            <p class="text-left">The changes that Jeremy and I helped to implement on the Alethiah website were unquestionably improvements upon the older website. However, the project did not leave a lot of room to do user research or testing. As the project lead, Jeremy developed the proposal that Alethiah agreed to, and it did not include user research or testing. Additionally, Alethiah was on an urgent deadline, hoping to improve their site in time to garner financial support from investors, which left little time for coordinating with users during the design process. </p>
            <p class="text-left">As a UX designer, I took as many opportunities as I could to incorporate user-centered techniques into our process, because I knew that doing so would make the website more of a success. Wherever I could, I implemented user-centered techniques, such as when I conducted tree testing for the navigation item, ‚ÄúLearn‚Äù. From beginning to end, I also made sure that the user‚Äôs perspective was represented and advocated for, and that we didn‚Äôt design components solely based on the easiest or quickest path for development, or to adhere blindly to business goals. Instead, I sought to find a balance the users, the developers, and the business that would product a good website that met the deadline. </p>    
            <p class="text-left">I plan to remain as a consultant for Alethiah, even after the ‚Äúphase one‚Äù of the website goes live. My hope is that, once Alethiah‚Äôs deadlines become less urgent, we will be able to find more time to use UX methods to ensure that the experience of Alethiah‚Äôs website is seamless, efficient, and delightful. </p>
