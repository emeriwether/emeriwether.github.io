        <p class="text-left">Pamela Simpson has owned and operated her own beauty salon in south Orange County for over thirty years. She rents a room or space inside other salons, and provides haircuts and coloring to over one hundred clients. <mark class="coralText boldText">In 2017, Pamela decided that she wanted to grow her business in profit, size, and reputation.</mark> To do this, she wanted to update her company’s branding, raise her prices, expand her digital presence, and possibly move into her own salon space sometime in the future.</p>
        <h5 class="text-left">Why me?</h5>        
        <p class="text-left">I’ve been getting my hair cut by Pamela for almost 5 years. To build up my UX portfolio, I’ve been on the lookout for opportunities to gain experience doing UX. When Pamela told me about her plans to expand her business, I offered to help her design and develop a website using user-centered techniques. She loved the idea, so now, in exchange for free haircuts, I have become her UX guru and web developer. <mark class="coralText boldText">We’ve gone through several rounds of iteration</mark> for both her business plans and plans for her website. The following case study outlines the process we undertook during the original iteration… </p>

        <p class="text-left"><mark class="coralText boldText">Overall, the weaknesses of each website outweighed the strengths.</mark> The two smaller salons, Studio Taka and International Hair Salon, had websites that were outdated and neglected. On these, it was difficult to find important information, like photos of the salon or the stylists’ work or the menu of services. The larger salons, Vogue and Serandi, had better websites, although they both seemed to focus more on flashy animation than good user experience. For example, hese websites failed to use the navigation to help orient users, and often the graphics obscured important text and photos. </p>

        <p class="text"><mark class="coralText boldText">*Note: If I were going to do this competitor analysis again, there are a few things that I would change…</mark></p>
        
        <p class="text">Firstly, <mark class="coralText boldText">I would modify the criteria that I used to find competitors.</mark> In this exercise, I selected competitors based only on two factors: Did they have a website? Were they located nearby Pamela’s salon? However, I have since realized that <mark class="coralText boldText">these two criteria were not sufficient to correctly distinguish Pamela’s competitors</mark>. Pamela’s salon is somewhat unique in her industry; she operates alone and in a small location, provides extraordinary and personalized customer service, and specializes in blonde hair coloring and highlights. The Vogue and Serandi salons, while located in Laguna Beach, are larger than Pamela’s salon, and provide a significantly different experience to clients. Comparing Pamela’s salon to these two is rather like comparing apples to oranges. <mark class="coralText boldText">Going forward, I would look for competitors who matched Pamela’s salon in location, size, and specialty.</mark></p>
        
        <p class="text">Additionally, <mark class="coralText boldText">I would not use the same format for a competitor analysis again.</mark> To compare each salon website, I took notes in four main categories. Unfortunately, these categories were large and left room for interpretation, so the notes I took within each category did not always compare directly from website to website. The notes were also lengthy, and difficult to digest quickly. <mark class="coralText boldText">Next time, I would construct an analysis chart that has smaller and more distinct categories</mark>. I would also include a way to help readers understand the information quickly, perhaps by using colors to represent success or failure, or simple “grades” for each website for each category.</p>

        <h5 class="text-left">Creating value for the users</h5>
        <p class="text-left">Before I began designing, I needed to get to know Pamela’s clients, so that I could figure out <mark class="coralText boldText">how to bring the users value with the website that I create</mark>. To do this, I spoke to five of Pamela’s current clients. Each interview was conducted over the phone, and lasted about thirty minutes. I asked the clients about their daily lives and technology use, and then asked them about their feelings and opinions of Pamela and her salon. After I finished all five interviews, the summarized results suggested a conclusion that I had not anticipated: Pamela’s current clients did not have much need for a website. They all love Pamela and her salon, they like the way things are now, and they are already familiar with all the details about the business.</p>
        
        <p class="text-left">This finding created a challenge for me, as <mark class="coralText boldText">I had to reassess who the target users of the website would be</mark>. During the client interviews, Pamela said she did not want to increase the number of clients she saw, which means that the website is not targeting new clients. From the interviews, I had learned that current clients will probably not use the website either. However, Pamela still wanted a website, because she wanted her salon to appear more professional and official, so that she can raise her prices. </p>
        
        <p class="text-left"><mark class="coralText boldText">After some consideration and discussion with Pamela, I came to the conclusion that the target users were still Pamela’s current clients</mark>, although the way that we needed them to “use” the website was not going to be conventional. We did not need them to use the website to look up her contact info, image gallery, or bio. But <mark class="coralText boldText">we did need them to visit the website and get an impression of a professional and official business</mark> that is starting to grow. To convince them to visit her website, we would need to add at least one feature that they might be interested in trying. 	</p>    
        
        <h5 class="text-left">Turning findings into artifacts</h5>
        <p class="text-left">To help me analyze the results of my interviews, and to better connect with the users, <mark class="coralText boldText">I created a few artifacts based on the findings of my research</mark>. I aggregated the data from the five user interviews into one persona, Jamie, and then also created an empathy map for her.</p>

I collected all the features that were unearthed in my discovery and research phases, and then assessed their value to the user and to the business. When assigning a priority to each feature, I also took into consideration the amount of effort necessary to implement the feature during development. To create a more visual and memorable representation of the priority of each feature, I plotted each feature on two different diagrams. One diagram was a one-dimensional scale of low-priority to high-priority. The other diagram, based on the Kano Model for customer satisfaction, graphed each feature on a two-dimensional plot, where one axis mapped technical effort from low to high, and the other axis mapped business and user value from low to high. The results of <mark class="coralText boldText">the diagrams made it clear which features I should focus on</mark> during the initial round of development, and which features would fit better in later iterations. </p>

I then took the best elements from my sketches, and created wireframes for mobile and desktop versions of all six pages. After sharing the wireframes with Pamela and getting feedback, I created low-fidelity mockups of each page using Omnigraffle.

        <h5 class="text-left">What works and what doesn't work</h5>
        <p class="text-left">Before I created a high-fidelity mockup, I wanted to find out whether the basic structure of my designs would work well for users. So, I began some user testing: I created ten task-based tests on usabilityhub.com, and also wrote a protocol for think-aloud interviews. I recruited four participants to do the task-based tests, sent them the links to the tests, and then I reviewed the results on usabilityhub.com. For the think-aloud tests, I recruited two participants, and conducted the tests in-person. With my protocol in hand, I asked them to complete a series of actions on the interactive prototype, and to tell me what they were thinking as they went along. I took note of their thoughts, as well as their actions and body language. </p>
        <p class="text-left">Both sets of testing pinpointed several critical usability flaws. For example, it quickly became clear that users did not know what to expect on the page that I had labeled “Featured”. This page was meant to showcase news articles and reviews that praised Pamela and her salon. Another finding suggested that the homepage did not have a clear purpose, and left users confused about what to do next. These flaws caused users to feel disoriented, and hindered their ability to accomplish their goals.</p>
        <p class="text-left">On the other hand, the tests also called attention to several design components that worked well. I had placed contact information in several conspicuous spots throughout the site, and all testers were able to find it easily. Additionally, users had clear and correct expectations about what they would find on the “Gallery”, “About”, “Services”, and “Contact” pages. </p>
        <p class="text-left">*Note: It turned out that my prototype was too low-fidelity, which caused a few problems during testing. In particular, users were frequently distracted by the placeholder graphic I used instead of real images. Next time, I will use higher-fidelity prototypes with enough graphics to seem realistic</p>

        <p class="text-left">By the time I had finished my user testing in December 2017, Pamela and I decided to put the project on hold. I had accepted a new part-time job, and Pamela was reconsidering some of her business plans.</p>
    
        <h5 class="text-left">Reflection</h5>
        <p class="text-left">As my first attempt at a UX Design challenge with a real client, I was proud of the work I had accomplished. There were several points when I realized that I should have approached a process differently, such as during my competitive analysis and while creating my site map. These were excellent learning opportunities. </p>    
        <p class="text-left">I also gained valuable insight into the challenges of balancing business requirements and user needs. There was a point during my process when I believed that I could not satisfy both Pamela’s business requirements and the needs of the users. However, through communication with Pamela and in-depth analysis, I was able to merge both requirements into one coherent solution. </p>
