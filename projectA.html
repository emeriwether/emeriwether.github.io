            <p class="text-left">Meet our customer DataGuardian, anonymized here to honor confidentiality agreements. Today, DataGuardian offers a solution to securely store what's essentially the diary of the business worldâ€”Salesforce CRM data, where companies jot down every customer interaction, from the smallest nod to the firmest handshake. Yet, the real magic DataGuardian plans to unleash is still on the horizon. Their next move? <span class="aquaText boldText">Transforming customers' data into sharp insights, set to empower businesses to make bold, informed decisions.</span></p>

            <h5>Unlocking the Vault of Dataâ€™s Potential</h5>
            <p class="text-left">To start, DataGuardian concentrated on their clients' sales data within Salesforce â€” just the first area among many, like marketing and operations, ripe for exploration. <span class="aquaText boldText">Their goal was to pinpoint the best opportunities for their clients' sales team to pursue</span>, turning mere data storage into a rich source of actionable insights.</p>           
            <p class="text-left">Enter the TensorIoT team. My role as the sole designer on this project was to distill the complexities of the available data and machine learning predictions into designs for a clear, engaging dashboard.

            <h5>The QuickSight Quest: Design Discovery to Sign-Off In Two Weeks</h5>
            <p class="text-left">In our initial discovery and design sprint, my knack for asking incisive questions and bringing customer ideas to life steered the project, ensuring smooth and successful progress. Here are some highlights:</p>
            
            <ol class="mainList">
              <li>
                <div class="listItemContent">
                  <strong>Kicking Off Design Discovery</strong> 
                  <p>To start, I tapped into our sales team's knowledge about DataGuardian's goals and challenges to shape some initial design sketches.</p>
                  
                  <div class="imageWithCaption">
                    <img src="../images/project1/dataGuardian_initial_sketch.png" alt="Sketches during discovery" class="discoveryImage clickable">
                    <div class="caption">
                      <p>In preparation for our initial discovery sessions, I crafted rough sketches reflecting our sales team's insights and the customer-defined use case as outlined in our contract:</p>
                      <ol class="nestedList">
                        <li>Ability to visualize inference results via a QuickSight dashboard</li>
                        <li>Opportunity Name</li>
                        <li>SFDC Stage</li>
                        <li>Close-Win likelihood</li>
                        <li>Link to SFDC Opportunity</li>
                        <li>Search & Filter functionality</li>
                      </ol>
                      <p>This sketch would help ground our conversations, allowing the stakeholders to point to parts of the design while they described what theyâ€™re looking for.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                  </div>
                  <p>Next up - my first meeting with the DataGuardian stakeholders, where I learned more about their business requirements and users. Some of my key takeaways from this session included:</p>
                </div>
              </li>
              
              <li>
                <strong>Creative Solution Crafting</strong> 
                <p>During our initial discovery call, I realized my sketches weren't compelling or "cool" enough for DataGuardianâ€™s needs. So, I revisited the designs, drawing inspiration from QuickSight's DemoCentral and discussing available data with our developers to brainstorm new graph concepts.</p>
                </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Initiative in User Research</strong> 
                <p>Despite typical project constraints like limited time and resources for user research, I identified a chance for valuable user insight right within our team. Given our own sales team perfectly matched the target user profile, I initiated some quick, direct user research.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Achieving Final Sign-off</strong> 
                <p>Through several more cycles of discovery, sketch iterations, and review with both the customer and developers, I honed in on graph choices that narrated a well-rounded and compelling story, enriched by insights from my user research.</p>
              </li>
            </ol>
          
            <h5>Bringing Design Dreams to Data Life</h5>            
            <p class="text-left">As we moved from design to development, our goal was to make sure the dashboard matched our vision, tackling technical challenges with creativity. I led the effort to keep design and development in sync, frequently reviewing the UI against my designs and discussing discrepancies with developers.</p>            
            <p class="text-left">Challenges arose when developers indicated certain parts of my designs werenâ€™t feasible within QuickSight. In those moments, I collaborated closely with the devs, ideating on alternative solutions that continued to meet user needs and deliver value, all while being achievable within QuickSight's framework and our project timeline.</p>
