        <p class="text-left">Pamela Simpson has owned and operated her own beauty salon in south Orange County for over thirty years. She rents a room or space inside other salons, and provides haircuts and coloring to over one hundred clients. <mark class="coralText boldText">In 2017, Pamela decided that she wanted to grow her business in profit, size, and reputation.</mark> To do this, she wanted to update her company’s branding, raise her prices, expand her digital presence, and possibly move into her own salon space sometime in the future.</p>
        <h5 class="text-left">Why me?</h5>        
        <p class="text-left">I’ve been getting my hair cut by Pamela for almost 5 years. To build up my UX portfolio, I’ve been on the lookout for opportunities to gain experience doing UX. When Pamela told me about her plans to expand her business, I offered to help her design and develop a website using user-centered techniques. She loved the idea, so now, in exchange for free haircuts, I have become her UX guru and web developer. <mark class="coralText boldText">We’ve gone through several rounds of iteration</mark> for both her business plans and plans for her website. The following case study outlines the process we undertook during the original iteration… </p>

        <ol>
            <li>The client's main goal was to increase her professionalism and raise hre prices for her current customers.</li>

        <p class="text-left"><mark class="coralText boldText">Overall, the weaknesses of each website outweighed the strengths.</mark> The two smaller salons, Studio Taka and International Hair Salon, had websites that were outdated and neglected. On these, it was difficult to find important information, like photos of the salon or the stylists’ work or the menu of services. The larger salons, Vogue and Serandi, had better websites, although they both seemed to focus more on flashy animation than good user experience. For example, hese websites failed to use the navigation to help orient users, and often the graphics obscured important text and photos. </p>

        <p class="text"><mark class="coralText boldText">*Note: If I were going to do this competitor analysis again, there are a few things that I would change…</mark></p>
        
        <p class="text indentText">Firstly, <mark class="coralText boldText">I would modify the criteria that I used to find competitors.</mark> In this exercise, I selected competitors based only on two factors: Did they have a website? Were they located nearby Pamela’s salon? However, I have since realized that <mark class="coralText boldText">these two criteria were not sufficient to correctly distinguish Pamela’s competitors</mark>. Pamela’s salon is somewhat unique in her industry; she operates alone and in a small location, provides extraordinary and personalized customer service, and specializes in blonde hair coloring and highlights. The Vogue and Serandi salons, while located in Laguna Beach, are larger than Pamela’s salon, and provide a significantly different experience to clients. Comparing Pamela’s salon to these two is rather like comparing apples to oranges. <mark class="coralText boldText">Going forward, I would look for competitors who matched Pamela’s salon in location, size, and specialty.</mark></p>
        
        <p class="text indentText">Additionally, <mark class="coralText boldText">I would not use the same format for a competitor analysis again.</mark> To compare each salon website, I took notes in four main categories. Unfortunately, these categories were large and left room for interpretation, so the notes I took within each category did not always compare directly from website to website. The notes were also lengthy, and difficult to digest quickly. <mark class="coralText boldText">Next time, I would construct an analysis chart that has smaller and more distinct categories</mark>. I would also include a way to help readers understand the information quickly, perhaps by using colors to represent success or failure, or simple “grades” for each website for each category.</p>

    <div class="large-6 cell bodyText">
        <h5 class="text-left">Creating value for the users</h5>
        <p class="text-left">Before I began designing, I needed to get to know Pamela’s clients, the users, so that I could figure out how to bring them value with the website that I create. To do this, I spoke to five of Pamela’s current clients. Each interview was conducted over the phone, and lasted about thirty minutes. I asked the clients about their daily lives and technology use, and then asked them about their feelings and opinions of Pamela and her salon. After I finished all five interviews, the summarized results suggested a conclusion that I had not anticipated: Pamela’s current clients did not have much need for a website. They all love Pamela and her salon, they like the way things are now, and they are already familiar with all the details about the business.</p>
        
        <p class="text-left">This finding created a challenge for me, as I had to reassess who the target users of the website would be. During the client interviews, Pamela said she did not want to increase the number of clients she saw, which means that the website is not targeting new clients. From the interviews, I had learned that current clients will probably not use the website either. However, Pamela still wanted a website, because she wanted her salon to appear more professional and official, so that she can raise her prices. </p>
        
        <p class="text-left">After some consideration and discussion with Pamela, I came to the conclusion that the target users were still Pamela’s current clients, although the way that we needed them to “use” the website was not going to be conventional. We did not need them to use the website to look up her contact info, image gallery, or bio. But we did need them to visit the website and get an impression of a professional and official business that is starting to grow. To convince them to visit her website, we would need to add at least one feature that they might be interested in trying. 	</p>    
        
        <h5 class="text-left">Turning findings into artifacts</h5>
        
        <p class="text-left">To help me analyze the results of my interviews, and to better connect with the users, I created a few artifacts based on the findings of my research. I aggregated the data from the five user interviews into one persona, Jamie, and then also created an empathy map for her.</p>

        <h5 class="text-left">Feature assessment</h5>

        <p class="text-left">Finally, I created a Feature Value Matrix to help me prioritize features before beginning the design phase. I collected all the features that were unearthed in my discovery and research phases, and then assessed their value to the user and to the business. When assigning a priority to each feature, I also took into consideration the amount of effort necessary to implement the feature during development. To create a more visual and memorable representation of the priority of each feature, I plotted each feature on two different diagrams. One diagram was a one-dimensional scale of low-priority to high-priority. The other diagram, based on the Kano Model for customer satisfaction, graphed each feature on a two-dimensional plot, where one axis mapped technical effort from low to high, and the other axis mapped business and user value from low to high. The results of the diagrams made it clear which features I should focus on during the initial round of development, and which features would fit better in later iterations. </p>
