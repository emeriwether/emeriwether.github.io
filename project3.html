        <div class="cell sectionQA"><p>For a class project, I was challenged to create something to further a social cause. Inspired by the #metoo movement, I saw an opportunity to tackle the issue of sexual harassment in public places. A large percentage of women experience sexual harassment by strangers in public, and this is as much of a gender rights issue as sexual harassment in the workplace. However, sexual harassment in public places is underrepresented in the social discourse, in part because it is an invisible issue. By raising awareness of the prevelance of "street harassment", I believe that we can start a movement to change the way we approach sexual harassment in public places.</p>

        <div class="cell sectionQA"><p>As part of the goal to raise awareness of the prevelance of sexual harassment, I constructed a plan to create a crowdsourced map that paints a realistic picture of the issue. There are existing apps that aim to do this, but they are cumbersome and have poor usability, causing the number of participants to dwindle. The app I envision allows users to pin an incident on a map quickly and easily, thereby encouraging users to report more incidents. To aid in the speed of submitting a report, the app also integrates with an IoT button that allows users to start a report in-the-moment, with the click of a button, and return to the app later to fill out the details and submit the report.<br>I've joined forces with five other team members, and we have continued to develop and improve the app, now called Collective Conscience.</p>

        <div class="cell sectionQA"><p>As one of two official UX designers in my group, I developed a set of rough sketches that outlined the main interactive sections of our app. The key interaction in the app allows users to submit a report to pin an incident of sexual harassment. I knew that the simplicity and usability of this feature is integral to our app's success, so I tried to think of ways to minimize required user input. Our group also discussed including a feature that would allow users to participate in a chat-room, so that they could seek help and advice from other users. However, in later designs, the chat-room feature was removed from our MVP, because it is not integral to the app's success.</p>

        <div class="cell subsectionThumb"><a href="" target="_blank"><img src="img/collectiveConscienceDescription/wireframes.png"></a></div>
        <div class="cell sectionQA"><p>After completing rough sketches of the app, I created a set of wireframes that focused on the key interactions in the app. Our group needed to use these wireframes to create a low-fidelity protoype for an initial round of user testing, so I imported placeholder images and text, as well. While creating the wireframes, my main goal was to simplify user interaction. Thus, I chose to have small number of navigation options that could fit on one line, and to have a one-page report feature. Also, I focused on emboldening users to take a stand against sexual harassment and report any incidents they experience. Based on user research that I conducted, existing apps don't provide users with any definitions of sexual harassment, which likely causes some users to experience doubt or hesitation about submitting a report. To counter this, I included a list of examples of sexual harassment on the landing page, and reminded users that sexual harassment is a form of gender violence and needs to be stopped.</p>

        <div class="cell subsectionThumb"><img src="img/collectiveConscienceDescription/mockup.png"></div>
        <div class="cell sectionQA"><p>Upon receiving feedback from our team UX researcher, our design team was tasked with updating our wireframes into higher-fidelity mockups. I redesigned the Home page to include text that was more descriptive of the functionality of our app, and had a hero image that was available for commericial use. I also chose to change the landing page based on whether the user has seen our app: first time users will be directed to the About page (previously home), while recurrant users will be directed straight to the report page. This is intended to reduce time and cognitive load required to submit a report. We also received user feedback that our choice of fonts did not create a "clean" aesthetic, so we changed the fonts to match Google and Apple's style guide recommendations for mobile devices. </p>

        <div class="cell sectionQA"><p>Because our development team did not have prior experience with iOS development, I am helping them deploy the code they created using the Ionic framework onto iPhones for demonstration and testing. I've had to study the Ionic framework to understand how it's built, so that I can smooth out any issues when the app is opened in xCode for deployment. I also learned how to integrate Google Map's and Flic's API's in the Ionic code, so that our app can talk to the buttons and display the crowdsourced map.</p>
