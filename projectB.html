        <p class="text-left">Pamela Simpson has owned and operated her own beauty salon in Laguna Beach for almost 30 years. She rents a room inside another salon, and provides haircuts and coloring to over 100 clients. <mark class="coralText boldText">In September 2017, Pamela told me that she wanted to grow her business in profit, size, and reputation.</mark> To do this, she wanted to make more money and move into her own salon space.</p>
        <h5 class="text-center">My Role</h5>        
        <p class="text-left">When Pamela, my hairstylist, told me about her plans to expand her business, <mark class="coralText boldText">I offered to help her design and develop a website using user-centered techniques</mark>. She loved the idea, so now, in exchange for free haircuts, I have become her UX guru. The following case study outlines the process we undertook during this iteration. </p>

        <p class="text-left"><mark class="coralText boldText">Next, I conducted a competitor analysis, to get an idea of what works and what doesn’t work on other hair salon websites.</mark> To find competing salons, I did a Google search for hair salons in Laguna Beach, and then selected four of the top results. I then created a matrix with columns for five criteria that I evaluated for each website:</p>
        <ol class="indentText">
            <li>Purpose of Site</li>
            <li>Summary of Content</li>

        <p class="text-left">After I evaluated each website, I also summarized my findings into <a class="aquaText boldText" data-open="competitorAnalysis">on the spreadsheet</a>. Overall, the weaknesses of each website outweighed the strengths. The two smaller salons, Studio Taka and International Hair Salon, had websites that were outdated and neglected. On these, it was difficult to find important information, like photos of the salon or the stylists’ work or the menu of services. The larger salons, Vogue and Serandi, had better websites, although they both seemed to focus more on flashy animation than good user experience. For example, these websites failed to use the navigation to help orient users, and often the graphics obscured important text and photos. </p>

        <p class="text-left">Before I began designing, I needed to interview the users of the proposed website, because I had learned that it was good UX protocol. I also wanted to get an idea of what kinds of features the users wanted to see on the website, so that the website was something that the users would need and would use.</p>

        <p class="text-left">I collected the contact info of five of Pamela’s clients, and scheduled interviews with them. I then created a <a class="aquaText boldText" href="interviewQuestions">list of questions</a> to ask each interviewee. Each interview was conducted over the phone, and lasted about 30 minutes.

This finding presented a problem for me. On the one hand, my client was telling me that her business goal was to publish a website. However, I was discovering that the target users were unlikely to use the website. I brainstormed ways to overcome this challenge: </p>

        <ol class="indentText">
            <li>I could look for features that would entice users to visit her website.</li>
            <li>I could extend the friendly relationship that Pamela had with her clients onto the website by including features such as:
            <ul>
                <li>Pamela’s current product recommendations</li>
                <li>Pamela’s recent news and creative inspirations</li>

I collected all the features that were unearthed in my discovery and research phases, and then assessed their value to the user and to the business. When assigning a priority to each feature, I also took into consideration the amount of effort necessary to implement the feature during development. To create a more visual and memorable representation of the priority of each feature, I plotted each feature on two different diagrams. One diagram was a one-dimensional scale of low-priority to high-priority. The other diagram, based on the Kano Model for customer satisfaction, graphed each feature on a two-dimensional plot, where one axis mapped technical effort from low to high, and the other axis mapped business and user value from low to high. The results of <mark class="coralText boldText">the diagrams made it clear which features I should focus on</mark> during the initial round of development, and which features would fit better in later iterations. </p>

        <h5 class="text-center">Setting Up the Tests</h5>
        <p class="text-left">Before I created a high-fidelity mockup, <mark class="coralText boldText">I wanted to find out whether the basic structure of my designs would work well for users</mark>. So, I began some user testing: I created <mark class="coralText boldText">ten task-based tests on usabilityhub.com</mark>, and also wrote <mark class="coralText boldText">a protocol for think-aloud interviews</mark>. I recruited four participants to do the task-based tests, sent them the links to the tests, and then I reviewed the results on usabilityhub.com. For the think-aloud tests, I recruited two participants, and conducted the tests in-person. With my protocol in hand, I asked them to complete a series of actions on the interactive prototype, and to tell me what they were thinking as they went along. I took note of their thoughts, as well as their actions and body language. </p>
        
        <h5 class="text-center">The Bad News</h5>
        <p class="text-left">Both sets of <mark class="coralText boldText">testing pinpointed several critical usability flaws</mark>. For example, it quickly became clear that users did not know what to expect on the page that I had labeled “Featured”. This page was meant to showcase news articles and reviews that praised Pamela and her salon. Another finding suggested that the homepage did not have a clear purpose, and left users confused about what to do next. These flaws caused users to feel disoriented, and hindered their ability to accomplish their goals.</p>

        <p class="text-left">On the other hand, <mark class="coralText boldText">the tests also called attention to several design components that worked well</mark>. I had placed contact information in several conspicuous spots throughout the site, and all testers were able to find it easily. Additionally, users had clear and correct expectations about what they would find on the “Gallery”, “About”, “Services”, and “Contact” pages. </p>

In particular, users were frequently distracted by the placeholder graphic I used instead of real images. Next time, I will use higher-fidelity prototypes with enough graphics to seem realistic.</p>

        <h5 class="text-center">Reflection</h5>
        <p class="text-left">As my first attempt at a UX Design challenge with a real client, I was proud of the work I had accomplished. There were several points when I realized that I should have approached a process differently, such as during my competitive analysis and while creating my site map. These were excellent learning opportunities. </p>    
        <p class="text-left">I also gained valuable insight into the challenges of balancing business requirements and user needs. There was a point during my process when I believed that I could not satisfy both Pamela’s business requirements and the needs of the users. However, through communication with Pamela and in-depth analysis, I was able to merge both requirements into one coherent solution. </p>
