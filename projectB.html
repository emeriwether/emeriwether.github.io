            <p>Hey there, you busy recruiters and managers &#128075 <br> If you're short on time, here's a quick rundown to get you up to speed. (Readers interested in more detail might prefer to skip this summary and start with the next section.)</p>
            <p>EcoLogistics Solutions, our anonymized client, packs bottles of beverages onto pallets in warehouses and ships them to customers like gas stations and grocery stores. They faced a major issue: the wrong products were being packed onto pallets, leading to customer complaints and confusion. They turned to TensorIoT to streamline operations with a cohesive application.</p>
            <p><span class="aquaText boldText">As a designer, I recognize that developers are key consumers of my Figma designs, so I focused on making the designs clear and actionable for them.</span> I converted existing designs from CloudScape to Material UI (the main project goal), enhanced design documentation with devs in mind, and prioritized key features with a phased approach to keep things realistic for our devs. Collaborating closely with the developers, I ensured the app was consistent and scalable, shipped on time, fully met the customer's needs, and made the developers look good.</span></p>

            <p class="text-left">Meet our customer DataGuardian, anonymized here to honor confidentiality agreements. Today, DataGuardian offers a solution to securely store what's essentially the diary of the business world—Salesforce CRM data, where companies jot down every customer interaction, from the smallest nod to the firmest handshake. Yet, the real magic DataGuardian plans to unleash is still on the horizon. Their next move? <span class="aquaText boldText">Transforming customers' data into sharp insights, set to empower businesses to make bold, informed decisions.</span></p>

            <h5>Unlocking the Vault of Data’s Potential</h5>
            <p class="text-left">To start, DataGuardian concentrated on their clients' sales data within Salesforce — just the first area among many, like marketing and operations, ripe for exploration. <span class="aquaText boldText">Their goal was to pinpoint the best opportunities for their clients' sales team to pursue</span>, turning mere data storage into a rich source of actionable insights.</p>           
            <p class="text-left">Enter the TensorIoT team. My role as the sole designer on this project was to distill the complexities of the available data and machine learning predictions into designs for a clear, engaging dashboard. This wasn't just about making data look pretty; it was about crafting a tool that would become indispensable to DataGuardian's clients, enabling their sales teams to zero in on opportunities with the biggest yields.</p>

            <h5>The QuickSight Quest: Design Discovery to Sign-Off In Two Weeks</h5>
            <p class="text-left">In our initial discovery and design sprint, my knack for asking incisive questions and bringing customer ideas to life steered the project, ensuring smooth and successful progress. Here are some highlights:</p>

                  <strong>Kicking Off Design Discovery</strong> 
                  <p>To start, I tapped into our sales team's knowledge about DataGuardian's goals and challenges to shape some initial design sketches.</p>

                              <p>In preparation for our initial discovery sessions, I crafted rough sketches reflecting our sales team's insights and the customer-defined use case as outlined in our contract:</p>
                              <p>Ability to visualize inference results via a QuickSight dashboard:</p>

                              <p>This sketch would help ground our conversations, allowing the stakeholders to point to parts of the design while they described what they’re looking for.</p>

                  <p>Next up - my first meeting with the DataGuardian stakeholders, where I learned more about their business requirements and users. Some of my key takeaways from this session included:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>The target users are business-to-business (B2B) sales reps and sales managers, especially in smaller firms where personalized engagement with customers can significantly influence success.</li>
                    <li>The current user journey involves sales reps guessing whether an opportunity will win or lose, relying purely on intuition—a hit-or-miss approach.</li>
                    <li>For this phase, the dashboard not only had to show how the data translates to dollars, but also needed to look “cool”, so DataGuardian’s customers would be excited to buy it.</li>
                  </ul>
                </div>

                  <strong>Creative Solution Crafting</strong> 
                  <p>During our initial discovery call, I realized my sketches weren't compelling or "cool" enough for DataGuardian’s needs. So, I revisited the designs, drawing inspiration from QuickSight's DemoCentral and discussing available data with our developers to brainstorm new graph concepts.</p>

            <p class="text-left">Challenges arose when developers indicated certain parts of my designs weren’t feasible within QuickSight. In those moments, I collaborated closely with the devs, ideating on alternative solutions that continued to meet user needs and deliver value, all while being achievable within QuickSight's framework and our project timeline.</p>
