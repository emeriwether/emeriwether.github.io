        <h3>A website for Pamela Simpson's Laguna Beach Hair Salon</h3>
        <p>As part of an individual project for a class at University of California Irvine, I am designing and developing a website for a privately-owned hair salon in Laguna Beach. Throughout the project, I am using a user-centered approach.

            <div class="description">
                <p><span class="bold">What:</span> I conducted a one-hour semi-structured interview with the salon owner, Pamela Simpson.

                <br><span class="bold">Where:</span> The interview was conducted in person, at Pamela's salon.

                <br><span class="bold">Why:</span> I conducted these user interviews to determine: 
                    <br> - the client's goals and vision for the site
                    <br> - the scope for the project
                    <br> - the project's success metrics
                    <br> - challenges and opportunities for the project

                <br><span class="bold">Results:</span> The three most important findings I made during the stakeholder interview were:
                    <br>1. The client's main goal is to increase her professionalism and raise her prices for her current customers.
                    <br>2. The client is not very interested in gaining new customers.
                    <br>3. The client wants the site to be maintainable in the future, even if I am unavailable.

            </div>

            <div class="description">
                <p><span class="bold">What:</span> I conducted five 30 minute interviews, with a mix of structured and unstructured questions.
                    
                <br><span class="bold">Who:</span> I interviewed five current clients of Pamela Simpson's salon.

                <br><span class="bold">Where:</span> The interviews were conducted remotely, with audio only.

                <br><span class="bold">Why:</span> I conducted these user interviews to better understand what my users want, and to gain context for the answers I receive in the interviews. I also wanted to know how users currently interact with Pamela and the salon.

                <br><span class="bold">Challenges:</span> As I conducted the interviews, I realized that some of my questions weren't successful, and confused the interviewees. For example, asking interviewees about the importance of each item in a list of hypothetical features did not yield good results. Next time, it would be better to ask this question in a survey, with a number scale for importance. 

                <br><span class="bold">Results:</span> Following the user interviews, I realized that current clients don't have much need for a website; they already have all the information they need. Current clients were also emphatic about including a feature for testimonials, because they wanted to make sure potential clients know about Pamela's artistic talents and listening skills, and the relaxing privacy of the salon.

            <div class="description">
            <p><span class="bold">What:</span> I created a table of information noting specific features, content, strengths, and weaknesses of five different websites for hair salons in Laguna Beach.

            <br><span class="bold">Why:</span> I conducted this competitor analysis in order to understand what works and what doesn't work in current hair salon websites. I also wanted to understand the competition, and get ideas for how to gain a competitive edge in the market. 

            <br><span class="bold">Challenges:</span> During the analysis, I was not able to find a lot of good websites for hair salons in Laguna Beach. If I were to do more competitive analysis, I would also include salon websites that are good, even if they aren’t located in Laguna Beach.

            </div>

            <div class="description">
                <p><span class="bold">What:</span> I created a Feature Value Matix - a table listing all the features I wanted to include in my portfolio site. Then, each feature received a rating based on its importance to the user, its importance to the business, and the difficulty involved in its development. I then took the results of the Feature Value Matrix, and turned them into two different types of diagrams that visually represented the prioritization of each feature. 

                <br><span class="bold">Why:</span> I created the matrix and diagrams to ensure that user needs, business needs, and developmental effort are considered for each feature. I also wanted to make it easy to prioritize features, and to help avoid scope creep.

                <br><span class="bold">How:</span> To select the features that went into this assessment, and to determine the values for each feature, I considered the results from my user interviews, the business requirements given by the client, and what other hair salons had done for their websites.    

                <br><span class="bold">Results:</span> The Feature Assessment provided me with both graphical and visual representations of the priority of each feature, and helped guide my creation of a site map.

                <br><span class="bold">How:</span> Using the feature value matrix and feature prioritization diagrams, I decided on 6 pages: Home, Gallery, About, Featured, Services, and Contact. Then I placed features on each page based on the results of my competitor analysis and user interviews.

                <br><span class="bold">Results:</span> The finished site map provided me with a clear and concise outline that helped me start wireframing the site.

                <br><span class="bold">Why:</span> I created these wireframes so that my initial design process could focus on the structure, layout, and content, and not on the aesthetics of the site. I completed the mobile wireframes first, because a responsive site that works well on mobile devices was an important business requirement. Also, designing the mobile wireframes first helped condense the content that I planned to include.

                <p><span class="bold">What:</span> I created  medium-fidelity mockups for desktops, using the Omnigraffle and Photoshop applications.

            </div>

            <div class="description">
                <p><span class="bold">What:</span> I created ten short user tests, to assess the usability of certain features on my site.

                <br><span class="bold">Who:</span> I recruited four participants myself from a pool of family and friends. The participants had a wide range of careers and technical experience. 

                <br><span class="bold">Where:</span> I created my tests on usabilityhub.com, and then emailed or messaged participants with the links to each test.

                <br><span class="bold">Why:</span> I conducted these tests to help me gain quantitative data that might uncover usability flaws with the current design for the site.

                <br><span class="bold">Challenges:</span> Due to limited resources, I was unable to get a good sample of users, so I ended up with four family members as testers. This may have led to some bias while answering my questions.

                <br><br><span>Results:</span>
                <br><span class="bold">Test 1:</span> 
                <br><span class="underline">Description:</span> This test showed users an image of the Home page, and asked what they expect to find on the Featured page.
                <br><span class="underline">Why:</span> After two informal user interviews, I began to suspect that users would not be able to correctly guess what content is on the Featured page. This would lead to bad usability, since they would have to spend cognitive effort considering the meaning of this navigation menu item, and because, if they were looking for reviews of Pamela’s salon, they would not know to look on the Featured page. 
                <br><span class="underline">Test Results:</span> Every tester was confused by the “Featured” navigation item, and was unable to correctly guess what would be on that page.
                <br><span class="underline">Designer's Response:</span> Going forward, I will need to find another label for this content. I will try “reviews” next.

                <br><br><span class="bold">Test 2:</span> 
                <br><span class="underline">Description:</span>  Users were asked to click on the location of the page where they would go to find the location of the salon.
                <br><span class="underline">Why:</span> From my own experience with business websites, I’ve found that the address of the business is often the most important thing for me to find. Accordingly, as a designer, I decided to feature the address prominently on every page, in multiple locations. I wanted to test that my design choices would indeed make it easy for users to find the address of the salon.
                <br><span class="underline">Test Results:</span> 1 user clicked on the address listed at the top of the page, 1 user clicked on the address in the footer, and 2 users clicked on the “Contact” nav item.
                <br><span class="underline">Designer's Response:</span> The test results confirmed that my placement of the address of the salon was prominent enough for users to be able to find quickly and easily. In the future, I’d like to confirm my assumption that users find this feature as important as I do.

                <br><br><span class="bold">Test 3:</span>
                <br><span class="underline">Description:</span>  Users were shown the Services page, and asked where they would go if they wanted to view examples of hairstyles that the salon had done in the past.
                <br><span class="underline">Why:</span> From my own experiences with business websites, I’ve found that I often want to see images of the item or service I am purchasing, especially after I have seen the price. Thus, I wanted to ensure that users who are on the Services page would be able to find example images of the services that the salon offers.
                <br><span class="underline">Test Results:</span> All users were able to correctly guess that examples of past work that Pamela has done would be located on the Gallery page.
                <br><span class="underline">Designer's Response:</span> The test results confirmed that users who are on the Services page would be able to quickly and easily find the page with example images of the services that the salon offers. In the future, I’d like to test additional ways to make it easy for users to simultaneously view prices and images of services.

                <br><br><span class="bold">Test 4:</span> 
                <br><span class="underline">Description:</span>  Users were shown the Contact Page, and asked to click where they would find directions to the salon. Users were also asked what they would expect to happen when they clicked where they did.
                <br><span class="underline">Why:</span> From my own experience as a user of business websites, I’ve found that the process of getting directions to a business can sometimes be tedious, because it requires a lot of steps. In my designs, I tried to reduce the number of steps required during this process, with the intention of helping users get through this task faster. I wanted to test that users would be able to find my button for directions quickly and easily, and I wanted to find out what they expected when they clicked the button. 
                <br><span class="underline">Test Results:</span> All users were able to find the button that would give them directions. Two of four users said that they would expect to be redirected to a map application or website when they clicked the button. 
                <br><span class="underline">Designer's Response:</span> The results of this test aligned with my expectations. Users were able to find the directions button, and anticipated that they would be redirected to a map application that would provide the directions. However, in retrospect, I believe this may have been a leading question. In my design, I also provided tools to interact with the map directly on the Contact page. It would be interesting to know whether users would utilize the map on the Contact page in conjunction with or instead of the directions button.
                <br><a href="https://usabilityhub.com/tests/498bfa601e4c/results/2b8b92d2c2">View the results of Test 4</a>  
                
                <br><br><span class="bold">Test 5:</span>
                <br><span class="underline">Description:</span>  Users were shown the Home page, and were asked to describe the purpose of the page and the purpose of the website. 
                <br><span class="underline">Why:</span> Because this is the landing page of the website, I wanted to ensure that it is immediately obvious what this website is for, and that users can quickly understand what they are looking at on the Home page.
                <br><span class="underline">Test Results:</span> All four users were able to accurately describe the purpose of the website. However, users struggled to provide unique answers when describing the purpose of the Home page, and gave the same answers that they gave for the first question (about the purpose of the website). In general, though, I am satisfied with the results of this test, and can infer that users are able to quickly and accurately guess the purpose of the website upon arriving at the landing page. 
                <br><span class="underline">Designer's Response:</span> I had been considering including a welcome message above the carousel hero image, to help make the purpose of the website explicitly clear to users. However, given the results of this test, I may not need to do this. I think, in the future, I may do an A/B test to see whether the welcome message helps. As far as the confusion caused by the question “What is the purpose of this page?”, I believe that I was asking that question to the wrong audience. As a UX Designer, I am able to articulate the purpose of the Home page. However, everyday users might not have ever thought about that topic before, and so would find it difficult to answer that question off the top of their head.

                <br><br><span class="bold">Test 6:</span>
                <br><span class="underline">Description:</span>  Users were shown the Services page, and asked to describe it with three adjectives. Then, users were asked to provide one thing they would change on the page.
                <br><span class="underline">Why:</span> During the stakeholder interview, Pamela requested that the website have a “retro/1950’s Hollywood glam” theme. To satisfy this request, I decided to place the list of services and prices on an image of a retro vanity mirror. I created this test to discover how this design would be received by users.
                <br><span class="underline">Test Results:</span> Overall, users responded well to this design, calling it unique, informative, and attractive. 
                <br><span class="underline">Designer's Response:</span> In retrospect, I am not sure this usability test was aligned with my UX goals. Instead, it was more about aesthetics, which I did not intend to focus on until later in the project.

                <br><br><span class="bold">Test 7:</span>
                <br><span class="underline">Description:</span>  Users were shown the Services page, and asked to describe the purpose of the page.
                <br><span class="underline">Why:</span> During the stakeholder interview, the client expressed that her number one goal for the website was to increase her prices. Accordingly, I wanted to ensure that users could quickly and efficiently determine the purpose of this page, so that they could focus their attention on the services and prices.
                <br><span class="underline">Test Results:</span> All four users were able to correctly guess the purpose of the page. 
                <br><span class="underline">Designer's Response:</span> The current design makes it easy for users to determine the purpose of the page. One comment left by a tester suggested adding images on the sides of the page, instead of plain black. In the future, I intend to redesign the mirror, so that images of the salon and of Pamela’s work look like photos that have been stuck in the frame of the mirror. I will repeat this test after the redesign, to make sure that the changes don’t affect users’ ability to determine the purpose of the page.

                <br><br><span class="bold">Test 8:</span>
                <br><span class="underline">Description:</span>  Users were shown an image of the Home page, and asked where they would go if they wanted to see a list of prices for services offered by the salon.
                <br><span class="underline">Why:</span> I labeled the navigation item for this feature Services, which will cause users to have to imply that Services includes a list of prices as well. I wanted to check if this connection was obvious to users, because I don’t want them to have to search for prices. 
                <br><span class="underline">Test Results:</span> All four users were able to correctly guess that prices would be located on the Services page.
                <br> Designer's Response: The results of this test suggest that users will be able correctly guess that prices can be found on the services page. However, if users had first taken any of the tests that showed the Services page, their results would have been clouded due to prior exposure.

                <br><br><span class="bold">Test 9:</span>
                <br><span class="underline">Description:</span>  Users were shown an image of the Home page, and asked where they would go to find out if the salon specializes in highlights. 
                <br><span class="underline">Why:</span> During my stakeholder and user interviews, I discovered that Pamela is a certified color specialist. So, I want to ensure it is easy for users who are looking for highlights to know that Pamela specializes in highlights. This test was meant to determine where users would look to find this information.
                <br><span class="underline">Test Results:</span> The results of this test were mixed. One user said that they would look at the About page to find out if the salon specialized in highlights, one user said they would look at the Services page, and two users said they would look at the Featured page.
                <br><span class="underline">Designer's Response:</span> I had intended to put this information on the About page, so it is good to know that some users would look there for it. Another user said they would look at the Services page, so I will need to include this information on that page, as well. As discovered in previous tests, the content of the Featured page is somewhat ambiguous, which is likely why 50% of the testers thought they’d find this information on the Featured page. Renaming or removing the Featured page will help better guide users to the correct locations for this information.

                <br><br><span class="bold">Test 10:</span>
                <br><span class="underline">Description:</span>  Users were shown an image of the Home page, and asked to click where they would go next.
                <br><span class="underline">Why:</span> I wanted a glimpse of the user’s priorities.
                <br><span class="underline">Test Results:</span> All four users answered this question differently. One user wanted to go directly to the Gallery page, one user wanted to go to the About page, one user wanted to go to the Services page, and one user wanted to scroll through the carousel hero image. 
                <br><span class="underline">Designer's Response:</span> The results of this test emphasized that users are not as interested in the Featured page. I may conduct this test again, after renaming the Featured page to Reviews.

            <div class="description">
                <p><span class="bold">What:</span> I conducted two half-hour cognitive walkthroughs. Participants were given tasks to complete, and asked to think outloud as they work.
                    
                <br><span class="bold">Who:</span> The two interviewees, who I recruited myself, were both family members.

                <br><span class="bold">Where:</span> The first test was done remotely (with screen share technology), and the other one was conducted in person. 

                <br><span class="bold">Why:</span> I conducted these tests to gain qualitative feedback that might help me identify usability issues on the salon's site.
                    
                <br><span class="bold">How:</span> First, I created a clickable prototype using the Invision website and images of my desktop mockups. Then I created a protocol, and conducted the interviews.

                <br><span class="bold">Challenges:</span> I had limited resources in collecting testers, so I ended up with two family members. This may have caused some bias in their feedback. Also, they had taken my usability tests, and so were already somewhat familiar with my website mockups.

                <br><span class="bold">Results:</span> After the two walkthroughs, I had uncovered several large usability errors, as well as several areas where improved usabilty would increase the efficiency of my goals for the site. For example, I found that one of the two users did not care about the About page. I’ll need to do more testing to see if other users feel the same, and I’ll want to make sure to test with potential clients. Also, I will need to include a message that says “By Appointment Only” to avoid people assuming that walk-ins are ok.

        <h3>Future Plans</h3>
        <p>
        The next stage of this project will be the initial development. During this stage, I will need to follow the requirements for development that the client expressed in the stakeholder interview. The website must be easy to maintain for future developers, in case I am unavailable. The website must consider security, must be cost efficient and responsive, and should have good Search Engine Optimization. Following these requirements, I intend to implement the website using the Desktop mockups and mobile wireframes. 
        <br> After the initial development is complete, I will conduct more user testing, to ensure that the live site has good usability. I will use usabilityhub.com to do more small user tests, and perform several in-person cognitive walkthroughs. 
        <br> Using the results of my user testing, I anticipate having to make changes to the site's implementation. Also, at this stage of the project, I intend to incorporate the client's requested theme - 1950's Hollywood Glam - into the design of the website. 
        </p>

        <h3>Stretch Goals</h3>
        <p>
        Once the website is fully implemented and working well, the client and I plan to consider incorporating two features that are slightly more complicated - online booking and product purchasing.
