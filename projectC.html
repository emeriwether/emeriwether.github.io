            <p>Hey there, you busy recruiters and managers &#128075 <br> If you're short on time, here's a quick rundown to get you up to speed. (Readers interested in more detail might prefer to skip this summary and start with the next section.)</p>
            <p>GlobalGreen Warehouses needed a streamlined way to manage their resource-intensive buildings. Their existing tools were outdated, scattered, and didn’t meet new climate or budget go.</p>
            <p>As the project’s sole UX designer, I guided the team from chaos to clarity. By questioning assumptions, listening to users, and overhauling the app, I helped cut through the noise and laid a foundation that made managing buildings—and their energy use—a whole lot smarter.</p>

            <h5>The Ask</h5>
            <p>GlobalGreen wanted a single app to unify building management, modernize tools, and enable smarter decisions—while cutting costs and speeding up future upgrades by keeping full control of the code.</p>           
            <p>Stratus (anonymized) was hired to build the app, but progress stalled without a clear vision. Scattered teams, conflicting goals, and jargon masked a bigger issue: no one had asked the right questions or involved the right people, leaving stakeholders unsure of their ultimate goal.</p>          
            <p>By Phase 3, Stratus brought in TensorIoT to get things moving and add clarity.</p>

            <h5>My Role</h5>
            <p>As the project’s sole UX designer, my job was to understand business and user needs, asking the hard questions to challenge assumptions and translate them into actionable designs. </p>           
            <p>Over three phases spanning two years, I helped drive the project’s success by aligning the team, making user-centered decisions, and setting clear, data-driven priorities.</p>

      <h5>Version 1 (April - July 2022)</h5>
      <p>When I joined, the team handed me a list of features and rigid instructions to cram everything onto a “single of glass”—just slap some “shiny” on it, no time for bigger questions.</p>           
      <p>While the polished mockup checked all the boxes requested by the team, the first demo gave stakeholders some serious concerns: we didn’t have access to the data needed to build these advanced features, and it was unclear whether this design even addressed the right user pain points.</p>

      <h5>Version 2 (August - December 2022)</h5>            
      <p>After the v1 demo flopped, the team was stuck, unsure where to go next. Three phases in, it hit us: we’d skipped the basics. I stepped up and started asking the tough questions:</p>            
      <ol>
        <li>What problems are we actually trying to solve?</li>
        <li>What data and resources do we really have to work with?</li>
        <li>And who’s calling the shots?</li>
      </ol>  
      <p>To tackle these questions, I identified Morgan, the Sr. Program Manager, as our key decision-maker, and together we pinpointed Regional Warehouse Managers as our central users. Reviewing existing apps and touring sites with Morgan laid the groundwork for key insights and next steps.</p>

  <p>With the groundwork laid, it was time to hear from the users. While Morgan provided helpful insights, I needed a broader perspective. Through interviews with six Regional Warehouse Managers, I uncovered the daily challenges and pain points—many of which were glaring in the old BMS app.</p>

  <img src="../images/project2/ecoLogistics_theming.png" alt="Static Insight Image" class="clickable" style="padding-top: 1em;">

  <p>Learning about the existing system’s pain points clarified why the first demo flopped—we had unintentionally mirrored its flaws. Ambiguous navigation and overwhelming, unfocused data were already problems, and our v1 redesign had only amplified them.</p>            
  <p>While I was busy interviewing users, the devs looked into what data was actually available for us to use. We then regrouped for a Long-Range Planning session, where I guided the team through insights and priorities, sparking ideas and creating a roadmap that earned enthusiastic stakeholder support 🥳.</p>            
  <img src="../images/project2/ecoLogistics_theming.png" alt="Static Insight Image" class="clickable" style="padding-top: 1em;">

  <p>With a clear roadmap in place, we turned our plans into action. I designed a new app that directly addressed both user pain points and our core business goals, transforming insights into a practical, cohesive solution. Here’s a look at how the new design came together:</p>            
  <img src="../images/project2/ecoLogistics_theming.png" alt="Static Insight Image" class="clickable" style="padding-top: 1em;">

  <h5>Version 3 (January - July 2023)</h5>            
  <p>After the holidays, fresh funding meant we could level up the app. Armed with feedback from v2, Morgan and I zeroed in on high-impact upgrades. The result? Smarter features that boosted user experience and business outcomes. Take a look:</p>

            <h5>Collaboration with Front-End Developers &#129309;</h5>
            <p>I loved working closely with our developers on this project. <span class="aquaText boldText">I’ve always been mindful that my designs serve as a map for developers to follow, and the better my instructions, the more likely the vision will be realized.</span> This close collaboration allowed me to see my designs in action and inspired a lot of learning and iteration on how I present designs and accompanying documentation, such as with the theming code.</p>

            <h5>Final Reflections and Impact</h5>
            <p>Throughout the design process, the customer appreciated the guidance and orchestration I provided. They were eager to hit deadlines and ensure the final application was a great experience and bug-free. </p>
            <p>Ultimately, this app is helping EcoLogistics build customer trust, assuring them that their deliveries will always be accurate. Consequently, this will enabled them to move towards a more cost-effective, hands-off delivery system. Soon, drivers will be able to drop pallets of beverages at retailers' doorsteps, leave a photo receipt, and move on to the next shop without needing to take inventory with the recipient.</p>
            <p><span class="aquaText boldText">This project not only met the customer’s immediate needs but also set a foundation for future efficiency and reliability in their delivery operations.</span></p>
