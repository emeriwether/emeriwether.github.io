        <h5>Background</h5>
        <p>Pamela Simpson has owned and operated her own beauty salon for almost 30 years. She rents a room inside another salon in Dana Point, and provides haircuts and coloring to over 100 clients. <mark class="coralText boldText">Pamela wants to grow her business in profit, size, and reputation. To do this, she wants to make more money and move into her own salon space.</mark></p>
        <h5>My Role</h5>        
        <p>After a break, I restarted this project in July 2018. (I previously worked on this project from October - December 2017. <a href="/projectB.html" class="aquaText boldText">Click here to view the case study for that iteration.</a>)</p>
        <p>Restarting the project was <mark class="coralText boldText">a great opportunity for me to gain further experience as a UX designer</mark>, and to showcase how my UX skills had improved since I had graduated from UCI. Last but not least, I wanted to finally publish a live website for Pamela!</p>

        <h5>The Business Needs and Goals</h5>
        <p>As we restarted the project, I conducted another informal stakeholder interview with Pamela, to see if her business needs and goals had changed since October 2017. For the most part, they remained the same:</p>
        <p class="indentText"><mark class="coralText boldText">Pamela’s main goal was still to earn more money through her business by raising her prices</mark>, so that she could have more independence as a business owner. To convince her current clients to stay with her as she raised her prices, Pamela wanted to create a website that reflected her business’ professionalism and high quality.</p>
        <p class="indentText">While Pamela still felt that she was unable to take on more clients at that time, she had begun to consider building a new, larger salon in Dana Point in the near future. This raised the possibility that she may be able to take on new clients sometime soon.</p>
        
        <h5>Design, Discovery, &amp; Validation</h5>
        <p><mark class="coralText boldText">To begin, I wanted to get a measure of what I knew about the project already, as well as uncover any gaps in my knowledge.</mark> Using an exercise that my career coach provided me with, I answered questions about the design, discovery, and validation of the project. I based my answers on data I had gathered during the previous iteration of this project and the results of my stakeholder interviews with Pamela.</p>
        <p>This exercise highlighted the areas of information that I was missing, and assumptions that I had that would need to be validated.</p>

        <h5>Competitor Analysis</h5>
        <p>Next, <mark class="coralText boldText">I conducted a competitor analysis, to get to know the strengths and weaknesses of Pamela’s competition.</mark> This would help me to make informed and strategic design decisions as I moved forward with the project.</p>
        <p>For this analysis, I selected three direct competitors. To select the competitors, I searched Google and Yelp for salons that matched at least three of the following five criteria:</p>
        <ol class="indentText shortList">
            <li>Located in Orange County, California</li>
            <li>Has fewer than 5 stylists</li>
            <li>Specializes in highlights</li>
            <li>5 or fewer salon chairs</li>
            <li>Has a website</li>
        </ol>
        <p>I then evaluated each of the three salon websites based on <a href="" class="aquaText boldText">Nielson’s 10 Usability Heuristics</a>, keeping track of my findings <a href="" class="aquaText boldText">in a spreadsheet</a>. Afterwards, I summarized and analyzed the results <a href="" class="aquaText boldText">in an insight report</a>, and identified six areas in which Pamela’s website could outperform those of her competitors. </p>

        <h5>User Surveys</h5>
        <p><mark class="coralText boldText">To get to know the users better, I began my research with an online user survey.</mark> I compiled a list of questions that would provide data about the demographics of Pamela’s clients, as well as some statistics about the clients’ relationship with Pamela. </p>

        <p>I ran the 13-question survey on Google Forms, and collected answers from 21 of Pamela’s current clients. After summarizing and analyzing the data <a href="" class="aquaText boldText">in an insight report</a>, I also created a list of insights and recommendations. </p>

        <h5>User Interviews</h5>
        <p><mark class="coralText boldText">To supplement the quantitative data that I discovered from the surveys, I wanted to collect some qualitative data.</mark> To do so, I conducted nine user interviews - six with Pamela’s current clients, and three with people who have not gone to Pamela’s salon.</p>
        
        <p>I created an interview script with two variations (one for current clients, one for non-clients). I interviewed the clients in Pamela’s salon, before or after their hair appointments. The three non-clients were interviewed over the phone. </p>
        
        <p>As with the user surveys, I summarized and analyzed the interview results <a href="" class="aquaText boldText">in my insight report</a>. My conclusions provided me with some further recommendations for the future design of the website. </p>


        <h5>Insight Report</h5>
        <p>As described above, I documented the results of my user research in an insight report that I shared with Pamela. In the report, I outlined several insights. One finding stood out as especially significant:</p>    
        <ol class="indentText">
            <li>Pamela has an uncommonly loyal set of clients, who are willing to travel from far away to see her. They love Pamela’s personality and her talent, and most have been visiting her for decades. They cannot imagine going to another salon. </li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>To capitalize on this insight, some of my recommendations included:</p>
        <ol class="indentText">
            <li>Extend the friendly relationship that Pamela has with her clients </li>
            <li>Prominently feature the loyalty of Pamela’s current clients, whenever Pamela is ready to gain new clients</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h5>Personas &amp; Empathy Maps</h5>
        <p><mark class="coralText boldText">Building on the understanding of the users that I gained from my research, I created three personas.</mark> Within the category of “current clients”, I noticed two distinct trends: a young adult generation (who had been going to Pamela since they were babies), and an older generation of women. I also created a persona to represent the non-clients that I had interviewed. </p>    
        
        <p><mark class="coralText boldText">To elaborate on these three personas, I also created empathy maps for them.</mark> I used data that I had collected from my research along with online resources to further define the emotions, preferences, and experiences of the three personas.</p>          
    
        <p><mark class="coralText boldText">These personas and empathy maps painted a very vivid picture of the target users of Pamela’s website</mark>, and helped guide all of my future design decisions.</p>

        <h5>MVP</h5>
        <p><mark class="boldText coralText">To test whether the website would be a success with Pamela’s target users, and to start ironing out problems early in the design process, I created an MVP. </mark></p>
        <p>I included the components that Pamela requested, such as a “new website coming soon” message, address, and contact information. I also showcased a few products that Pamela recommended, as a way to extend the Pamela-client relationship outside of her salon. I knew I’d want to be able to monitor the usage of the site, so I also added Google Analytics. </p>
        <p>After the MVP site was live for a few weeks, I checked the Google Analytics. The site usage had gone up, with most users arriving via Facebook or LinkedIn. (Pamela added the URL to her salon’s social media pages.)</p>

        <h5>Scenario Maps</h5>
        <p>In preparation for the information architecture phase of my project<mark class="boldText coralText">, I wanted to think carefully about the different kinds of tasks that my personas would most likely do.</mark></p>
        <p>To that end, I created three scenario maps, one for each persona. The maps outlined the different steps each persona would need to take to complete their goal. </p>   

        <h5>Storyboards</h5>
        <p>Next, I translated the scenario maps into three different storyboards that illustrated the experiences my personas would likely encounter when trying to perform their most common tasks. <mark class="boldText coralText">Being able to visualize the stories allowed me to further explore the experiences my users would encounter</mark>, and to develop a deeper empathy with them.</p>
        <p>To create the storyboards, I used graphics from the <a href="https://experience.sap.com/designservices/approach/scenes" class="aquaText boldText">SAP AppHouse’s Scenes collection</a> and Adobe Stock, and put the scenes together on a Google Slides deck. </p>
