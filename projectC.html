            <p>Hey there, you busy recruiters and managers &#128075 <br> If you're short on time, here's a quick rundown to get you up to speed. (Readers interested in more detail might prefer to skip this summary and start with the next section.)</p>
            <p>GlobalGreen Warehouses needed a streamlined way to manage their resource-intensive buildings. Their existing tools were outdated, scattered, and didn’t meet new climate or budget go.</p>
            <p>As the project’s sole UX designer, I guided the team from chaos to clarity. By questioning assumptions, listening to users, and overhauling the app, I helped cut through the noise and laid a foundation that made managing buildings—and their energy use—a whole lot smarter.</p>

            <h5>The Ask</h5>
            <p>GlobalGreen wanted a single app to unify building management, modernize tools, and enable smarter decisions—while cutting costs and speeding up future upgrades by keeping full control of the code.</p>           
            <p>Stratus (anonymized) was hired to build the app, but progress stalled without a clear vision. Scattered teams, conflicting goals, and jargon masked a bigger issue: no one had asked the right questions or involved the right people, leaving stakeholders unsure of their ultimate goal.</p>          
            <p>By Phase 3, Stratus brought in TensorIoT to get things moving and add clarity.</p>

            <h5>My Role</h5>
            <p>As the project’s sole UX designer, my job was to understand business and user needs, asking the hard questions to challenge assumptions and translate them into actionable designs. </p>           
            <p>Over three phases spanning two years, I helped drive the project’s success by aligning the team, making user-centered decisions, and setting clear, data-driven priorities.</p>

          <h5>Version 1 (April - July 2022)</h5>
          <p>When I joined, the team handed me a list of features and rigid instructions to cram everything onto a “single of glass”—just slap some “shiny” on it, no time for bigger questions.</p>           
          <p>While the polished mockup checked all the boxes requested by the team, the first demo gave stakeholders some serious concerns: we didn’t have access to the data needed to build these advanced features, and it was unclear whether this design even addressed the right user pain points.</p>

          <h5>Bridging the Theming Gap &#127912;</h5>            
          <p>As I started handing my designs off to our front end developer, I noticed that he was styling components individually in the code. I realized this was likely because my documentation wasn’t speaking his language. He was just following our usual process, but I saw an opportunity to improve for cleaner, maintainable code.</p>            
          <p>To address this, I used the MUI Theme Creator to generate theme code, and added custom code for box shadows and border radiuses. While we iterated on the code together to get the syntax right, my initial work gave the developer what he needed to start theming efficiently.</p>
          <p><span class="boldText">Outcome:</span> By reaching out to the developer, I discovered this gap between design and development and addressed it, leading to a more cohesive and scalable app, saving development time, and ensuring styling consistency across the board.</p>

            <h5>Collaboration with Front-End Developers &#129309;</h5>
            <p>I loved working closely with our developers on this project. <span class="aquaText boldText">I’ve always been mindful that my designs serve as a map for developers to follow, and the better my instructions, the more likely the vision will be realized.</span> This close collaboration allowed me to see my designs in action and inspired a lot of learning and iteration on how I present designs and accompanying documentation, such as with the theming code.</p>

            <h5>Final Reflections and Impact</h5>
            <p>Throughout the design process, the customer appreciated the guidance and orchestration I provided. They were eager to hit deadlines and ensure the final application was a great experience and bug-free. </p>
            <p>Ultimately, this app is helping EcoLogistics build customer trust, assuring them that their deliveries will always be accurate. Consequently, this will enabled them to move towards a more cost-effective, hands-off delivery system. Soon, drivers will be able to drop pallets of beverages at retailers' doorsteps, leave a photo receipt, and move on to the next shop without needing to take inventory with the recipient.</p>
