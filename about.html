            <p>Like most people, life has been a winding road for me. I was born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area, and moved to Germany and then Missouri during high school. Then, while pursuing an undergraduate degree in Anthropology, I also spent a summer in South Korea. Once my BA studies were complete, I was unsure of how to best use my training in Anthropology, so I moved back to California, discovered the career of User Experience Design, and am now finishing a degree in Human-Computer Interaction. It sometimes seems as though every step in my journey was preparing me for UX. With such a deep knowledge of culture and human behavior, an eye for design, and a wide palate of HCI skills, I am excellently positioned for a career in UX. Good times ahead! <br><br>- Eleanor</p>
