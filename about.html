                                    <p>My passion for crafting excellent user experiences extends beyond career goals, affecting everything in my life from how I arrange the spices in my kitchen cabinet to my appreciation of well-designed apps. I take immense satisfaction in usable experiences, no matter how small, and strive to turn the world around me into a better place. <br><br>With education in human-computer interaction, anthropology, and international studies, I bring a unique perspective and wide-ranging set of skills to the table. Some of my best-honed skills include: user research (interviews, ethnographies, competitive analysis), wireframing and designing mockups, user testing (cognitive walkthroughs, heuristic analysis, administering task-based tests), and prototyping. I learn fast, and along the way I have also picked up skills such as game development (in C# and Swift), web development (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript), and network diagnostics.<br><br>- Eleanor</p>
