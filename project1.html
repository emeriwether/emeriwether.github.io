        <h3>An online portfolio to showcase my best work</h3>
        <p>As part of a class assignment, and also to help me get a job as a UX Designer, I designed and developed this website. I used a user-centered approach, conducting user research and testing throughout the design and development process. I also coded the website from scratch. Everything, including the responsive design, is hand-made.</p>

        <h4>User Interviews</h4>
        <p><b>What:</b> I conducted 3 one-hour long interviews, with a mix of structured and unstructured questions; given somewhat informally
            
        <br><b>Who:</b> I intervered 3 current User Experience Designers in lead positions
                      
        <br><b>Where/When:</b> The interviews were conducted remotely, with audio only, in October 2017.
                    
        <br><b>Why:</b>I conducted these user interviews to confirm that I'm creating a product that people want, to better understand what my users want, and to gain context for the answers I receive in the interviews.
                          
        <br><b>Challenges:</b> On some topics, I received conflicting opinions. For example, one interviewee said it is very important to include a personal photo on a portfolio site, while another interviewee said that doing so is a very bad idea.
