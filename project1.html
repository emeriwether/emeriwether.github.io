        <h2>Personal Portfolio Website</h2>
        <img src="/img/Work_Screenshot.png">
        
        <h3>An online portfolio to showcase my best work</h3>
        <p>As part of a class assignment, and also to help me get a job as a UX Designer, I designed and developed this website. I used a user-centered approach, conducting user research and testing throughout the design and development process. I also coded the website from scratch. Everything, including the responsive design, is hand-made.</p>
        <h3>Role</h3>
        User Research, Design, Development, User Testing
        <h3>Dates</h3>
        <p>August 2017 - Present</p>

        
        <h3>User Research</h3>

        <h4>User Interviews</h4>
        <p><b>What:</b> I conducted 3 one-hour long interviews, with a mix of structured and unstructured questions; given somewhat informally
            
        <br><b>Who:</b> I interviewed 3 current User Experience Designers in lead positions
                      
        <br><b>Where/When:</b> The interviews were conducted remotely, with audio only, in October 2017.
                    
        <br><b>Why:</b>I conducted these user interviews to confirm that I'm creating a product that people want, to better understand what my users want, and to gain context for the answers I receive in the interviews.
                          
        <br><b>Challenges:</b> On some topics, I received conflicting opinions. For example, one interviewee said it is very important to include a personal photo on a portfolio site, while another interviewee said that doing so is a very bad idea.
                      
        <br><b>Results:</b> Following the user interviews, I was able to confirm that an online portfolio is necessary for getting a job in user experience design. I also gained excellent insight into what lead UX Designers look for in online portfolios when hiring.

        <h4>Competitor Analysis</h4>
        <p><b>What:</b> I created a table of information noting specific features, content, strengths, and weaknesses of 5 different portfolios.
            
        <br><b>Who:</b> I selected the portfolios of 5 different designers: 4 user experience designers and 1 visual designer. 
                      
        <br><b>When:</b> This competitor analysis was conducted in October 2017.
                    
        <br><b>Why:</b> I conducted this competitor analysis in order to understand what works and what doesn't work in current UX portfolios, and to gain inspiration for how I want to structure my own portfolio site.
            
        <br><b>How:</b> I selected competitors based on the following criteria: similar career and goals, admirable portfolio, utilized a range of methods to display portfolio.
                          
        <br><b>Challenges:</b> Narrowing down the number of portfolios to include in the analysis was difficult because there are so many good ones. It was also challenging to complete a thorough analysis, because there are so many intricate parts of each site.

        <h4>Feature Value Matrix</h4>
        <p><b>What:</b> I created a table listing all the features I wanted to include in my portfolio site. Then, each feature received a rating based on its importance to the user, its importance to the business, and the difficulty involved in its development.
            
        <br><b>Who:</b> This matrix considered the importance to the business (that's me), the users (anyone who might consider hiring me to do UX Design), and the development team (that's me again).
                      
        <br><b>When:</b> I created this Feature Value Matrix in October 2017.
                    
        <br><b>Why:</b> I created this matrix to ensure that user needs, business needs, and developmental effort are considered for each feature. I also wanted to make it easy to prioritize features.
                     
        <br><b>How:</b> To select the features that went into this matrix, and to determine the values for each feature, I considered the results from my user interviews, the requirements for the class assignment, and what other UX Designers have on their portfolios.    
            
        <br><b>Challenges:</b> It was difficult for me to feel confident while determining the amount of developmental effort involved in each feature, because I have never done this kind of development before.
