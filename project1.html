        <h2>Personal Portfolio Website</h2>
        <img src="/img/Work_Screenshot.png">
        
        <h3>An online portfolio to showcase my best work</h3>
        <p>As part of a class assignment, and also to help me get a job as a UX Designer, I designed and developed this website. I used a user-centered approach, conducting user research and testing throughout the design and development process. I also coded the website from scratch.
        </p>
        <h3>Role</h3>
        User Research, Design, Development, User Testing
        <h3>Dates</h3>
        <p>August 2017 - Present</p>

        
        <h3>User Research</h3>

        <img src="">
        <h4>User Interviews</h4>
        <p><span>What:</span> I conducted 3 one-hour long interviews, with a mix of structured and unstructured questions.
            
        <br><span>Who:</span> I interviewed 3 current User Experience Designers in lead positions.
                      
        <br><span>Where:</span> The interviews were conducted remotely, with audio only.
                    
        <br><span>Why:</span> I conducted these user interviews to confirm that I'm creating a product that people want, to better understand what my users want, and to gain context for the answers I receive in the interviews.
                          
        <br><span>Challenges:</span> On some topics, I received conflicting opinions. For example, one interviewee said it is very important to include a personal photo on a portfolio site, while another interviewee said that doing so is a very bad idea.
                      
        <br><span>Results:</span> Following the user interviews, I was able to confirm that an online portfolio is necessary for getting a job in user experience design. I also gained excellent insight into what lead UX Designers look for in online portfolios when hiring.

        <h4>Competitor Analysis</h4>
        <p><span>What:</span> I created a table of information noting specific features, content, strengths, and weaknesses of 5 different portfolios.
            
        <br><span>Who:</span> I selected the portfolios of 5 different designers: 4 user experience designers and 1 visual designer. 
                             
        <br><span>Why:</span> I conducted this competitor analysis in order to understand what works and what doesn't work in current UX portfolios, and to gain inspiration for how I want to structure my own portfolio site.
            
        <br><span>How:</span> I selected competitors based on the following criteria: similar career and goals, admirable portfolio, utilized a range of methods to display portfolio.
                          
        <br><span>Challenges:</span> Narrowing down the number of portfolios to include in the analysis was difficult because there are so many good ones. It was also challenging to complete a thorough analysis, because there are so many intricate parts of each site.   
                      
        </p>

        <h4>Feature Value Matrix</h4>
        <p><span>What:</span> I created a table listing all the features I wanted to include in my portfolio site. Then, each feature received a rating based on its importance to the user, its importance to the business, and the difficulty involved in its development.
            
        <br><span>Who:</span> This matrix considered the importance to the business (that's me), the users (anyone who might consider hiring me to do UX Design), and the development team (that's me again).
                                          
        <br><span>Why:</span> I created this matrix to ensure that user needs, business needs, and developmental effort are considered for each feature. I also wanted to make it easy to prioritize features.
                     
        <br><span>How:</span> To select the features that went into this matrix, and to determine the values for each feature, I considered the results from my user interviews, the requirements for the class assignment, and what other UX Designers have on their portfolios.    
            
        <br><span>Challenges:</span> It was difficult for me to feel confident while determining the amount of developmental effort involved in each feature, because I have never done this kind of development before.
        </p>

        <img src="">
        <h4>Feature Prioritization Diagram</h4>
        <p><span>What:</span> I created two infographics, representing the prioritization of my features. One diagram is a one-dimensional line that organizes features from lowest to highest priority. The other diagram is a two-dimensional "Kano Model", where one axis represents the business and user value, and the other axis represents developmental effort. 
                    
        <br><span>Why:</span> I created these graphics to provide a graphic visualization of the priority of my features, and to give me a starting point for development (start with features with high value and low effort).
            
        <br><span>How:</span> I used the results from the Feature Value Matrix to determine the order and placement of the features.

        <h3>Design and Initial Development</h3>
        
        <img src="">
        <h4>Site Map</h4>
        <p><span>What:</span> I created a hierarchical organization of the pages I planned to include on my website, as well as the placement of the features I wanted to include.
                    
        <br><span>Why:</span> I created this site map so that I could plan out how many pages I wanted and what I would include on each page.
            
        <br><span>How:</span> Using the feature value matrix and feature prioritization diagrams, I decided on 4 pages: Work, About, Resume, Contact. Then I placed features on each page based on the results of my competitor analysis and user interviews.
                      
        <br><span>Results:</span> The finished site map provided me with a clear and concise outline that helped me start wireframing the site. 
        </p>

        <img src="">
        <h4>Wireframing</h4>
        <p><span>What:</span> I created both low-fidelity and medium-fidelity wireframes using the Omnigraffle application.
                                  
        <br><span>Why:</span> I created these wireframes to increase the consistency of the site, and the efficency of my development.
        </p>
        <a href=""></a>
        
        <img src="">
        <h4>Initial Development</h4>
        <p><span>What:</span> I developed a live, working website, based on the wireframes I designed.
            
        <br><span>How:</span> I developed the website using semantic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I used the Jekyll framework and GitHub Pages to publish the site. To learn how to do this, I spent a lot of time reading books and taking tutorial classes on lynda.com.
                          
        <br><span>Challenges:</span> Since I've never done web development before, this was the most challenging part of the assignment. Hand-coding the responsiveness of the site required a lot of tinkering and trial-and-error. It was also difficult to pause development before I felt completely satisfied with the site; this was necessary, however, so that I could conduct user testing. 
                      
        <br><span>Results:</span> The result of the initial development was a live, working site! (With a lot of placeholders and flaws.) But it was sufficient for user testing, which was the goal. I also ended up with a to-do list that was two pages long, of features that I wanted to test or implement later. 
        </p>

        <h3>User Testing</h3>
        
        <img src="">
        <h4>User Stories</h4>
        <p><span>What:</span> I created a collection of narratives that describe why users would want to use the features on my site. 
            
        <br><span>Who:</span> I decided to focus on users who are lead UX designers or UX hiring managers, because these are the users I want to target the most. Also, I had the most insight into what these users want, since I interviewed 3 of them. 
                    
        <br><span>Why:</span> I created this list of user stories to help me stay user-focused, and to prevent scope creep. The user stories also helped guide the user testing that I conducted. 
            
        <br><span>How:</span> I created the user stories by listing the main features on each page, and then breaking down each feature into individual tasks. Then, using the results from my user interviews, I considered why users would want to complete each task. I also used my own intuition and experience to determine why users would want to complete tasks. 
                          
        <br><span>Challenges:</span> It was difficult to place myself in the position of a UX Hiring manager, since I have never actually been in that role. I do worry that I have made some assumptions that would not align with the real users' goals. However, I tried my best to consult the results of my user interviews.

        <img src="">
        <h4>Cognitive Walkthroughs</h4>
        <p><span>What:</span> I conducted 3 half-hour cognitive walkthroughs. Participants were given tasks to complete, and asked to think outloud. 
            
        <br><span>Who:</span> The 3 participants that took the tests had varying backgrounds, although all 3 have been in management positions that included hiring new staff. I interviewed 1 UX Designer, 1 Production Assistant, and 1 Software Engineer. 
                      
        <br><span>Where:</span> The first test was done remotely (with screen share technology), and the other two were conducted in person. 
                    
        <br><span>Why:</span> I conducted these tests to identify usability issues on my portfolio site.
                          
        <br><span>Challenges:</span> At the time of the tests, there were few multi-step or complicated tasks available on the website. So many of the tasks seemed overly simplistic. Additionally, the walkthroughs were conducted over the Thanksgiving holiday, so it was difficult to recruit participants. 
            
        <br><span>Surprises:</span> I thought I knew exactly how people would answer my questions, especially since the tasks were so simple. However, there were several times that I was really thrown off by unexpected answers.  
                      
        <br><span>Results:</span> After the three walkthroughs, I had uncovered several large usability errors, as well as several areas where improved usabilty would increase the efficiency of my goals for the site. 
        </p>

        <img src="">
        <h4>User Tests</h4>
        <p><span>What:</span> I created 5 tests: Test 1 was a short answer test that asked participants to name 3 adjectives that described the "About" page. Test 2 was an A/B test that asked participants to select whether they preferred the project gallery page to be titled "Work" or "Portfolio". Tests 3 and 4 were 5-second tests, which asked users to find the skills listed on the "About" page, and to determine the purpose of the "Work" page. Finally, Test 5 was a click test, asking users to click on where they would go to get ahold of me on the "Contact" page.  
            
        <br><span>Who:</span> I recruited participants myself from a pool of family and friends. About half of the participants were already familiar with the site. The participants had a wide range of careers and technical experience. 
                      
        <br><span>Where:</span> I created my tests on usabilityhub.com, and then emailed or messaged participants with the links to each test.
                    
        <br><span>Why:</span> I conducted these tests to help me uncover usability flaws, especially in small, isolated tasks. 
                          
        <br><span>Challenges:</span> These tests were necessarily done over the Thanksgiving holiday, so it was difficult to recruit participants. The participants that I did recruit were family and friends, and it seems as though it may have been difficult for them to give me objective feedback. Additionally, most of my participants were unfamiliar with user testing, and so they later told me that they were confused about the rules and expectations for the tests. Finally, usabilityhub.com is not conducive to testing for small screen sizes, so I was only able to get feedback about the desktop version of my site.  
                      
        <br><span>Results:</span>
        <br>Test 1:

        <br>Test 4: It is not easy for people to tell what the "Work" page is about. No participant was able to give the correct answer for this question.
