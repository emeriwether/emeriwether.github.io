        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p>These days, every User Experience Designer needs an impressive website to showcase their best projects. As part of a class assignment, and also to help me get a job as a UX Designer, I designed and developed this very website. I used a user-centered approach, conducting user research and testing throughout the design and development process. I also coded the website from scratch. Everything, including the responsive design, is hand-made.</p>
